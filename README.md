# .tmux


Maintaining some my-self prefered settings of tmux, tmux is really useful when we want do some stuff on remote server. Currently I did those change in my `.tmux.conf` file:

- Enable mouse scroll to saw more log messages;
- Enable mouse click to switch panel;



To install this, simply:

```
cd ~
ln -s .tmux/.tmux.conf ./
```
